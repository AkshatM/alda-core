# alda-core

The core machinery of Alda, implemented in Clojure.

## Components

* **alda.parser** (reads Alda code and transforms it into Clojure code in the context of the `alda.lisp` namespace)

* **alda.lisp** (a Clojure DSL which provides the context for evaluating an Alda score, in its Clojure code form)

* **alda.sound** (generates sound based on the data map produced by parsing and evaluating Alda code)

* **alda.now** (an entrypoint for using Alda as a Clojure library)

* **alda.repl** (an interactive **R**ead-**E**val-**P**lay **L**oop for Alda code)

For more details about how each component works, see the alda-core [development guide](doc/development-guide.md).

## Development

### Prerequisites

Development on the Alda core library requires that you have the [Boot](http://boot-clj.com) build tool installed. This allows you to run the `test` and `dev` tasks to run tests and run the Alda REPL locally for development.

### `boot test` task

To run the unit test suite, run `boot test`.

#### Adding tests

It is generally good to add to the existing tests wherever it makes sense, i.e. whenever there is a new test case that Alda needs to consider. [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is a good idea.

If you find yourself adding a new file to the tests, be sure to add its namespace to the list of test namespaces in `build.boot` so that it will be included when you run the tests.

The automated test battery includes smoke tests where we parse and evaluate all of the example Alda scores in the `examples/` directory. If you add an additional example score, be sure to add it to the list of score files in `test/alda/examples_test.clj`.

### `boot dev` task

You can use the `boot dev` task to run an Alda REPL with any local changes. You may find this convenient for experimenting in Alda after making changes to the code.

> NOTE: We eventually want to [rewrite the Alda REPL as part of the Java client](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/issues/154).


### Logging

Alda uses [timbre](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre) for logging. Every note event, attribute change, etc. is logged at the DEBUG level, which can be useful for debugging purposes.

The default logging level is WARN, so by default, you will not see these debug-level logs; you will only see warnings and errors.

To override this setting (e.g. for development and debugging), you can set the `TIMBRE_LEVEL` environment variable.

To see debug logs, for example, you can do this:

    export TIMBRE_LEVEL=debug

When running tests via `boot test` and troubleshooting a failing test, it may be helpful to use debug-level logging by running `TIMBRE_LEVEL=debug boot test`.
